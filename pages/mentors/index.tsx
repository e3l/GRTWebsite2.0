                At GRT, we pride ourselves on being primarily student-led, but we could not achieve any of our successes
                without the incredible guidance of our mentors. Our mentors come from a wide range of engineering backgrounds,

                giving us the tools we need to find answers and innovate; they "teach us to fish."
